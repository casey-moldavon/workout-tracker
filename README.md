# workout-tracker

For this project, i was given front-end code (only) for a fitness workout/exercise trakcing app. My responsability was to build the backend and make this crazy thing work!
​
## Getting Started
​
I first started with familiarizing myself with the code that had been written by someone else, something I'm quite sure tends to occur in the tech world. This was quite a lengthy process as it all seemed to jump from one section to another, file to file in a seemingly disorganized way with little instruction on what the final product was meant to do or how it would ultimately function.

If im being completely honest, there was a very brief demo of the finished project but i was heavily distracted by another project and could not remember for the life of me what was shown. This required a great deal of investigation later on.

Once i felt i understood what the premade code was doing, i moved on to creating models for workouts and excercises. These had to be altered later, specifically with how date was written (changing from date to day) and adding totalDuration (both changes occuring on the workout.js file within the models folder).

After the models were made, i worked on the server.js followed by the html routes. From there, the real nightmare began when working on the api routes. This took me literal days to figure out and only mannaged to finish them just a few hours ago.

I had to constantly test and create different exercises, going to and from VS Code and the Browser, restarting the server and console logging everything.

I wish i could give a more detailed walkthrough of the process to solve the issues i encountered with this app but i consistently encountered issues and consistently fixed them, often through a lot of google searches and test changes. Being more of a Front-end developer, this was certainly quite the challenge but learned a lot and became much more familiar with api routes. I definitely spent enough time with them.
